# Code-to-Give-Hackathon
For 85 years, Morgan Stanley has been committed to serving communities around the world. A central part of that mission is helping charitable organizations by providing technical support and innovative solutions. Code to Give is the latest initiative in this global effort. It's a special series of global virtual hackathons to help nonprofits around the world solve real-word issues and further their missions through tech. As part of Code to Give, Morgan Stanley pairs its technologists with students and recent graduates to build cutting-edge digital tools for our nonprofit partners.
